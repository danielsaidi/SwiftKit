## About SwiftKit

SwiftKit adds extra functionality to the Swift programming language, like extensions to already existing types as well as completely new utilites, services, etc. 

You can explore the various sections in the [documentation][Documentation] and the demo app.



## Supported Platforms

SwiftKit supports `iOS 13`, `macOS 10.13`, `tvOS 13` and `watchOS 6`.



## Installation

The best way to add SwiftKit to your app is to use the Swift Package Manager.

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/SwiftKit.git
```

SwiftKit also supports CocoaPods:

```
pod DSSwiftKit
```

You can also clone the repository and build the library locally.



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] contains more information, code examples, etc., and makes it easy to overview the various parts of the library.

The online documentation is currently iOS only. To generate documentation for other platforms, open the package in Xcode, select a simulator then run `Product/Build Documentation`.



## Demo Application

This project contains a demo app that lets you explore SwiftUIKit on iOS and macOS. To run it, just open and run `Demo/Demo.xcodeproj`.
